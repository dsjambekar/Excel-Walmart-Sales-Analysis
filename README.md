# Walmart Sales Analysis Dashboard
## Project Overview

This project analyzes Walmart’s historical weekly sales data to uncover sales trends, seasonality patterns, store-level performance, and volatility risks.
The goal is to transform raw sales data into actionable business insights using an interactive Excel dashboard.

The dashboard helps answer questions such as:
- How do sales behave across the year?
- What impact do holidays have on weekly sales?
- Which stores contribute most to total revenue?
- Which stores show high volatility and operational risk?

## Objectives

- Analyze weekly sales trends across multiple years
- Measure the impact of holidays on sales performance
- Identify top and bottom performing stores
- Detect high volatility stores that may require tighter operational controls
- Build a clean, executive-ready dashboard for decision-making

## Dashboard Highlights
### Key KPIs

Total Sales: $6.7B+
- Average Weekly Sales: ~$1.05M
- Maximum Weekly Sales: ~$3.8M
- Number of Stores: 45
- Holiday Sales Uplift: ~8%

### Visual Insights

- Weekly Sales Trend: Clear seasonality with sales peaking during weeks 48–52 (holiday season)
- Holiday vs Non-Holiday Comparison: Holidays consistently outperform non-holiday weeks
- Top Performing Stores: A small subset of stores contributes disproportionately to total revenue
- Bottom Performing Stores: Identifies underperforming locations for potential intervention
